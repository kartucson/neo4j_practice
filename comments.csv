2656,2464,0,I know mate but I have to cluster them according to the topics created after I apply LDA on my collection. Each topic should be represented as a vector in order to compare each document with each topic and find the correspondent topic or topics for each doc.,2014-11-14T11:03:49.373,5029,
2657,2468,0,Thanks for a good answer. I guess I am definitely in the 100s of millions ( I have updated my question).,2014-11-14T15:59:55.560,1256,
2659,2474,1,"This format is called ""JSON"". Curly braces form objects, while square ones represent arrays. Most programming languages have libraries for parsing JSON (e.g. for R see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2061897/parse-json-with-r) question), so parsing it becomes trivial task.",2014-11-14T23:46:31.913,1279,

2661,2470,0,SVMs support binary classification by nature. Your classes can't be vectors. You're converting vectors to a scalar norm of some vector difference. These still aren't binary classes. I don't think SVM is the tool you want; maybe you can clarify the problem?,2014-11-15T14:22:14.240,21,

2667,2470,0,Each element in classes A and B are vectors of a given dimension d. In other words you have d features to consider to classify a vector as A or B.,2014-11-15T21:40:10.550,5042,
2668,2470,0,"A class is like a label that can apply to a feature vector. It makes sense to say a vector can have label A but then what does the notation |A-C| mean? the norm of the difference of vectors that are in class A / C, is a scalar, and you say the scalar belongs to class A'?",2014-11-15T22:00:06.307,21,
2669,2470,0,What I meant by |A-C| is actually the Mahalanobis transformation where I calculate the covariance and centroid of C and then I use those two parameters to transform my classes A and B into A' and B' which are the respective multivariate distances. Effectively now every element of A' and B' are scalars.,2014-11-16T00:46:11.980,5042,
2670,2470,0,Basically I want to know if this is a valid transformation in the sense that I am not informing the algorithm (double dipping?) because I know that B is closer to C than A.,2014-11-16T00:48:16.663,5042,
2671,1128,1,You can't be successful if you don't have a goal. What kind of insights do you want to get? You have to define that first. Otherwise: Just use element-wise addition and multiplication. You're done now! Or aren't you? If you understand why this doesn't do it - maybe you can make progress.,2014-11-16T16:06:42.517,723,
2673,1128,0,"@Gerenuk : This would be a reasonable response if I wanted to test a specific hypothesis about specific time series.  I'm interested in the meta-problem... i.e. are there *any* systems that go beyond element-wise addition and multiplication?  If so, what ",2014-11-16T19:38:34.597,3328,
2674,1128,1,"@aSteve: I could make up many non-trivial algebras, too. It would be a very tedious process asking you every time why this particular algebra does not suit your needs. It's really much more fruitful if there is an notion of what you want to achieve.",2014-11-16T20:55:24.630,723,
2675,1128,0,"@Gerenuk:  I'm trying to establish a taxonomy of algebras with existing (practical or academic) applications.  Every significantly distinct algebra is of interest - as is the context in which it was deemed valuable.  Ultimately, I would like to establish ",2014-11-16T23:13:09.507,3328,

2677,2462,0,One of the problems with this is that you don't know which nucleotide starts the codon. So you'd need to create 58 categorical features. Worth a try though.,2014-11-17T10:47:45.140,136,
2679,2487,0,"What structure is your source data? If it is just the string ""Camera"", what kind of associations are you hoping to make - properties that a physical camera might have with variation, properties related to selling cameras? The latter is what your list looks like, but if you are starting with just a string word, you might just as well get into more open-ended word association (e.g. ""Camera"" is a word derived from a Latin root, it has X million Google hits, it is of interest to photographers etc etc)",2014-11-17T14:07:16.237,836,
2680,2487,0,"Thanks for your reply Neil. It would be just a string for ""camera"" and I would be looking for any words that would be associated to it, whether that be physical properties or non physical such as ""light"".",2014-11-17T15:20:58.313,5066,
2681,2462,0,"That is a good point. However, since 30 are in E and 30 are in I (or the reverse), we can assume that the first neucleotide starts the codon? I might be totally wrong here so please correct my hypothesis/ reasoning.",2014-11-17T16:19:40.490,847,
2682,2451,1,"heckman sample selection correction.  The regression only applies to records where fraud is observed, controlling for the probability of fraud occuring.

2683,2477,0,So you are suggesting we should treat it as a regression problem (never consider it as a classification one). My hunch was that there must be some way to combine regression and classification together to solve such problems better.,2014-11-17T17:32:10.240,847,

2686,2477,0,"Seems like you'll have many classes then? Try regression, it's a suggestion.If you predict greater than a threshold, fraud, else, not fraud. Very simple and see if that works.you'll need to define the threshold.",2014-11-17T19:53:38.543,3083,

2689,2451,0,"@justincress: Thanks for the comment. If you could go into more detail about how I could pose it as a supervised learning problem, it would be great.",2014-11-17T21:02:45.883,847,
2690,2487,0,This is mostly a request to find a database of particular data. I think it's not quite the right type of question for this StackExchange.,2014-11-18T00:23:22.677,21,

2695,2492,1,The issue becomes bigger when I have 11 such variables,2014-11-18T10:21:23.107,5075,
2696,2492,0,"Agreed. It becomes more and more complicated as the number of choices/ options increase. But you choose to restrict the number of categories to, for example, 5. This can be done by using the top 4 choices/ options as they are and treating everything else as ""other"".",2014-11-18T10:23:00.820,847,

2708,2496,0,"This was for a homework assignment related to SVM, I didn't need to create a Visualization, I just was curious if it had ever been dome with anything outside 3 dimensions.  I am not entirely sure I know what you are referring to when you say multiple 3-D images, just so I am clear, I take it to mean creating several models with only 3 explanatory variables in them, correct?",2014-11-18T20:17:52.327,5023,
2709,2496,0,"Correct. I sometimes also show images with individual variables on two axis, and a weighted average of the remaining variables (in your case, 4 of them) on the third axis.

2721,2500,2,"Clustering the products is easy enough (look up k-means or Gaussian mixture models), but recommending them will be difficult unless you can propose a model which relates them to the users. Since you have no training data for a supervised model you need to get it from somewhere; e.g., market research. Otherwise you can make up some heuristics yourself and use it to build a Bayesian prior, but I suspect this more complexity than you are comfortable with.

Worry about mahout later; you need an algorithm, a model first.",2014-11-19T19:32:03.240,381,

5417,5135,0,"No, it is not. It is even simpler than Naive Bayes; it looks like a simplified version of k-nearest neighbours classification. They group together or cluster the training examples. Each cluster contains the examples in the training set which have the same values in the input variables. Each cluster's class is computed as the rounded mean of the surviving value for the individuals in the cluster, and the results are stored in a lookup table.

7201,6735,0,"What type of analysis do you intend to apply to the variables, this will affect the answer, as will the size of your data set. In some circumstance highly correlated variables may contain useful discriminative information.

7205,6735,0,@image_doctor - Thank you very for your advice. My intention of doing chisquare test is to check for the collinearity between the variables. I got confused between the purposes of collinearity and chisquare test. Hence i raised the question. Thanks again.,2015-08-10T10:36:31.123,9793,

7209,6707,0,"Make some test to what is best for you. Typically 0 is the optimal solution. That means that there is no better solution than this one. Since it's an hyperparam, you can learn it via a neural network.",2015-08-10T20:55:57.640,11113,

7221,6638,0,"That's true, though on the other hand I think it's good to use ""meaningful"" indicators of orientation. Calculating a hash would probably be unique, but two very similar states would be mapped completely differently.",2015-08-11T19:39:57.133,10907,

$$ \frac{993.0 * 988.0 * 993.3}{992.7^2}/1000 = 0.98889591936 $$
And then normalize so that these two numbers add to one (as probabilities should):
$$ P = \frac{0.01056108087}{0.01056108087 + 0.9888959194} = 0.01056681865 $$
